## Calculator


A calculator project I built from scratch with two version. the first one in vanilla JavaScript and the second one in Next.js React framework. It help to understand in depth DOM, Parse with Array, State management and tailwind and it's part of a serie of project to understand in depth both tech.

## What i learned
I learned a lot while building the calculator project i deepened my understanding of loops and how they can be used to efficiently perform repeated tasks in JavaScript. I also improved my knowledge of the DOM to reflect user interactions. In addition, I gained practical experience with state management, learning how to track and update values over time, including using previous state values to ensure correct calculations. This project taught me how to break down problems into smaller with a step-by-step process. I can also add that in Javascript i had to break down the different value and operator into different parts of a array to proprely handle simple calcul and with React there was no need because so it was much more simple...
